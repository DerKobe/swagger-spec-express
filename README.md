# swagger-spec-express

> Programmatically generate your Swagger specification (JSON) file.

[![NPM][spe-npm-icon] ][spe-npm-url]

[![Build status][spe-ci-image] ][spe-ci-url]

A library that allows you to programmatically annotate your existing express api with [swagger](http://swagger.io/) info and then generate and validate your json spec file. All without completely starting over or changing the structure of your express routes. Please note that this document is still being written.

## Why

There are already a few libraries out there to add Swagger documentation to your [express](https://expressjs.com/) api, like [swagger-node-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-node-express) and [swagger-node](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node) which work really well, however they require you to either start from scratch or change your routes to work with their format. This libary is different and can easily be added to an existing and established express api using the normal patterns you are used to.

\##Installation
Requires Express 4.x

Install the package:

> npm install swagger-spec-express --save-exact

Basic code example:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var swagger = require('swagger-spec-express');
var packageJson = require('./package.json');

var app = express();
var options = {
    title: packageJson.title,
    version: packageJson.version
};
swagger.initialise(app, options);

app.get('/swagger.json', function (err, res) {
    res.status(200).json(swagger.json());
}).describe({
    responses: {
        200: {
            description: "Returns the swagger.json document"
        }
    }
});

swagger.compile();
var port = 3000;
app.listen(port, appListening);
function appListening() {
    console.info(packageJson.name + ' is listening on port ' + port);
}
```

This will create a very basic express app that serves up the swagger.json document when you navigate to **<http://localhost:3000/swagger.json>**

The [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) file that will be used to validate the supplied
metadata on the route can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eXigentCoder/swagger-spec-express/master/lib/schemas/meta-data.json) in addition the fields are detailed below. Wherever possible the library tries to adhear to the official [Swagger Specification](http://swagger.io/specification/) so that is a good place to look for extra information about what you can specify.

## Describing Your Routes

As seen above, once you have called initialise on your app, the describe method is automatically added and can be added to routes you declare directly on your app object.

But what if you want to use the router object? In the above example code above add the following to the top of the page:

```javascript
var exampleRouter = require('./example-route');
```

And then after calling **swagger.initialise(app, options);** add the following:

```javascript
app.use(exampleRouter);
```

Code for the example router:

```javascript
'use strict';
var express = require('express');
var swagger = require('swagger-spec-express');
var router = new express.Router();
swagger.swaggerize(router);
module.exports = router;

router.get('/one', function (req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({example: 1})
}).describe({
    responses: {
        200: {
            description: "Returns example 1"
        }
    }
});
```

## Adding the UI

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### compile

Will gather together all your described app routes and compile them into a single document to be served up by your api when you call `json`.
Can only be called once `initialise` has been called. Should only call this once you have completely finished describing your routes.

-   Throws **[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)** Will throw an error if `initialise` wasn't called or if you don't yet have any routes defined or if there are certain errors in your metadata

Returns **void** 

### validate

Will validate the internal json document created by calling `compile`.
This is done using the [ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) validator against the [official JSON schema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-schema-official). \* @throws {Error} Throws an exception if called before `compile` or `initialise`.

Returns **{valid: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean), errors: [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)>, message: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)}** The result of the validation

### json

Returns the swagger specification as a json object.

-   Throws **[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)** Throws an exception if called before `compile` or `initialise`. You do not need to call `validate` first.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** The Swagger JSON object describing your api

### initialise

Will initialise your app with the required swaggers-spec information.
In addition you can pass in some options which will be used when generating the swagger JSON document later on.
Both British and American spelling supported.

**Parameters**

-   `app` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** The express app class that you want to describe using swagger
-   `options` **[InitialisationOptions](#initialisationoptions)** The options object, used to control how the swagger document will be generated

Returns **void** 

### InitialisationOptions

This MUST be the host only and does not include the scheme nor sub-paths. It MAY include a port. If the host is not included, the host serving the documentation is to be used (including the port).

-   `basePath` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The base path on which the API is served, which is relative to the host. If it is not included, the API is served directly under the host. The value MUST start with a leading slash (/).

-   `schemes` **[array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The transfer protocol of the API. Values MUST be from the list: "http", "https", "ws", "wss". If the schemes is not included, the default scheme to be used is the one used to access the Swagger definition itself.
-   `consumes` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** A list of MIME types the APIs can consume.

## Roadmap

### Low

-   Currently populating rootDocument.responses but then injecting the responses directly into the operation. Should use the $ref
-   Currently populating rootDocument.parameters but then injecting the responses directly into the operation. Should use the $ref
    ### Medium
-   Ability to describe the app like a router (alternate to passing all the data into the init method).
-   Ability to manually specify routes.
-   More tests
    ### High
-   addResponse should look for model & arrayOfModel
-   Better error messages in general so you don't need to debug
-   Ability to inject certain things into parameters. E.g. many GET routes will have GET /thing/:identifier would be nice to inject the name in there
-   Add examples to this document
-   when using arrayOfModel the schema doesn't have an id, so makes it harder to use ajv. Currently we just wrapping in {items:}. Still an issue?
-   custom fields not on all schemas?
